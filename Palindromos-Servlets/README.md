# Palindromos-Servlets

This is a college project for the course for Computation 2. Here, I learned how to use GlassFish and Servlets, and how to create a simple web application. The application is a website where you can check if a word is a palindrom and store it. Also, you can search for palindromes with an especific string and delete the words.
